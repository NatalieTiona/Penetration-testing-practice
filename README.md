Perform a service and version scan using Nmap to determine which services are up and running:


Run the Nmap command that performs a service and version scan against the target.

Run the command that sets the RHOST:

Run the Icecast exploit.

Run the command that runs the Icecast exploit.

Run the command that performs a search for the secretfile.txt on the target.

Run the command to performs a search for the recipe.txt on the target:
